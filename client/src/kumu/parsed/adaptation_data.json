            "description": "Seawalls are a hard coastal defence used to prevent erosion of the shoreline. Seawalls are built along the shoreline to prevent sediment from washing away and to block wave energy from traveling up the beach. Seawalls can protect from flooding until overtopping occurs. Seawalls are an inflexible and unsustainable defence and are mainly used when critical infrastructure or development is occurring directly along the shoreline such as with railway lines or buildings. A more sustainable implementation of seawalls is to erect them further inland so that there is a buffer zone for coastal ecosystem processes to take place, but the seawall exists as a last line of defence.",

Strategies to measure sea surface temperature can be employed to identify  and forecast areas at risk of an increase in bacterial abundance such as Vibrio spp., thereby enabling appropriate measures such as early warning systems to be applied to reduce and prevent infection. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has developed a global Vibrio spp. tool that provides 24-hour updated mapping data.",

The structures attenuate wave energy, resist high water pressure, and minimise overtopping. Sea dikes are a hard defence and reduce the dynamic ecosystems they occupy. However, in particularly at risk areas, these structures provide critical protection. The failure of sea dikes can be catastrophic in extreme conditions.",

Mixed crop techniques where multiple crop varieties are grown together can reduce the spread of fungal spores and can make some crops more resistant to pests. Some crop species may benefit from being covered to reduce the spread of spores, although ventilation is generally required to minimise infection.\n\nFungicide and disease treatments may be required, although natural alternatives should be used where possible to reduce the environmental impacts.\nPlanting genetic crop varieties which are resistant to disease and fungal infections may be beneficial.",

It is a measure of land use in urban areas.\n\nThe best application of plant cover is through planting trees, preferably aligned, which provide local benefit, while grass can affect heat accumulation and help to maintain an adequate surface temperature.  Vegetation placement and the design of urban green infrastructure should be justified and applied where it most efficiently reduces exposure to heat stress, such as in green cycling/walking corridors. Green and blue infrastructure can also be designed to absorb rainwater, reducing and flow rate and volume. A reduction in flow can also reduce the likelihood of pollution from urban environments from contaminating watercourses. \n\nPlant and tree species should be selected based upon the requirements of the local area and consideration of how certain species, such as allergenic species, may impact health during the pollen season.",

Adaptation decisions rely on understanding the potential pathways of different climate impacts. Examples of essential knowledge include predicted sea level rise, existing local protection, or the coastal topography indicating areas at risk. Alongside knowledge of risk, knowledge of adaptation techniques and the characteristics of the local area for successful implementation are necessary. One example is the importance of knowing local sediment characteristics. Sediment characteristics can influence beach nourishment, dune construction, and even tourism.",
