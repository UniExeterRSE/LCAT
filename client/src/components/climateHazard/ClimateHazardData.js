                    The UK's climate is warming. Our warmest years on record have occurred in the last 10 years. One
                    consequence of this is an increase in <strong className="text-emphasis">frequency</strong> and{" "}
                    <strong className="text-emphasis">intensity</strong> of heatwaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As warming continues in the future, UK summers are predicted to become hotter and drier on average
                    with regional variations existing. As a result, heatwaves will become:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More severe.</li>
                    <li>More frequent.</li>
                    <li>Longer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Urban environments (e.g. cities) are likely to experience even greater heatwave intensity due to the
                    <strong className="text-emphasis"> urban heat island effect</strong>. Urban heat island effect
                    describes urban areas being a lot warmer than the rural areas around them because of denser
                    populations and infrastructure.

                    The UK has become wetter over the recent decades, with an increase in frequency and intensity of
                    rainfall and flooding. Flooding is affected by:

                    is expected to experience drier summers, although the rain that does fall is also likely to be more
                    intense, also impacting flood risk.
