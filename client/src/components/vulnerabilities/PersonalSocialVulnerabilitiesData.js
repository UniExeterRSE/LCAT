                        Social isolation is associated with compounding vulnerabilities raising overall risk. These can
                        include old age, poverty and poor health. Social isolation is particularly high for single
                        pensioner households and those isolated with dependent children face practical difficulties in
                        responding to an extreme weather event due to lack of support networks.
