            <p>
                Everyone will be exposed to the impacts of climate change & extreme weather events but not everyone is
                affected equally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some individuals or communities will be more exposed to hazards. Some may be more vulnerable due to
                personal and social vulnerabilities. These circumstances impact people’s ability to cope with, adapt to
                and recover from climate events and extreme weather. Those experiencing multiple vulnerabilities are
                more vulnerable to climate impacts.
